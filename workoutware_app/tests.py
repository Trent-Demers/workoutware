"""
Django test module for the workoutware_app.

Currently:
    - This file does not contain any active test cases.
    - It serves as a placeholder so the app has a standard tests module.

How to use (for future reference):
    - Create test classes that inherit from django.test.TestCase.
    - Name methods starting with `test_` so Django’s test runner detects them.

Example structure (for later, not implemented now):

    class SimpleExampleTest(TestCase):
        def test_example(self):
            # Arrange / Act / Assert
            self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)

For the final presentation:
    - It is enough to mention that this file is ready for future unit tests
      but the current project scope did not require automated tests.
